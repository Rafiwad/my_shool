                    <h2>Our History</h2>
                    <p>
                        Nalerigu Senior High School is located in the northern region in the East Mamprusi district of
                        Ghana. It is a mixed school that offers General Science, General Arts, Agriculture, Business,
                        and Home Economics. It mostly draws students from the West Mamprugu area schools and the far east.
                        <br><br>
                        GREAT Nalerigu Senior High School was founded in the 1950s, first started as an Agricultural college.
                        <br><br>
                        The school was finally established in 1972, as known today, after going through some cycles of
                        academic statuses as an educational institution. The school has grown from a small, innovative,
                        and nurturing school in the heart of Nalerigu to a vibrant, diverse, and inclusive institution that
                        values social equity and the environment.
                        <br><br>
                        In 2019, the school was recognized as the 20th-ranked school in Ghana by the Ghana Education Service
                        (GES).
